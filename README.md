# Breast Cancer Image Classification with Deep Learning

This project applies **Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs)** to the task of **breast cancer diagnosis** using medical imaging data.  
It compares **binary classification** (benign vs malignant) with **multi-class classification** (cancer subtypes), evaluating models through multiple metrics and visualizations.
